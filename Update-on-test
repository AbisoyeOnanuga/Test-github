Update - brute forced my way around making commits and merging changes from remote Github to the local folder.
----------------------
Possible to merge changes made online with local file.
succesful upload of file to Github
merged the fetched online source with local folder using:
git pull main Repost --allow-unrelated-histories
This means I can now develop in Visual Studio Code and make source code upload and changes to Github.
Granted practice is still needed in pushing and pulling updates and committing merge changes from online fetches
